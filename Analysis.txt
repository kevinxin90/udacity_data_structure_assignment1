1. Task0
Total: O(n)
Read in the files and turn them into list has time complexity of O(n).
Find and print the first/last item has time complexity of O(1).
So total complexity of the code is O(n)

2. Task1
Total: O(n)
Read in the files and turn them into list has time complexity of O(n).
Find and store all tel nums in a set has time complexity of O(n)
so total complexity of the code is O(n)

3. Task2
Total: O(n)
Read in the files and turn them into list has time complexity of O(n),
Record call times for each tel num has time complexity of O(n),
Loop through the dict storing tel num call times and find max has time complexity of O(n),
so total complexity of the code is O(n)

4. Task3
Total: O(nlog(n))
Read in the files and turn them into list has time complexity of O(n),
Loop through each call has time complexity of O(n)
Sort the area code of all call receivers has time complexity of O(nlog(n)),
so total complexity of the code is O(nlog(n))

5. Task4
Total: O(nlog(n))
Read in the files and turn them into list has time complexity of O(n),
Loop through each call and each text has time complexity of O(n)
Find the difference between all call makers and non tel marketers using python set differencee has time complexity of O(n),
Sort the tel marketers's nums havs time complexity of O(nlog(n))
so total complexity of the code is O(nlog(n))
